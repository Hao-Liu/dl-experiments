Recurrent Zoomable Attention Model
==================================

This is an augmented version of RAM introduced in [Mnih 2014 paper|https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6247].

Instead of using 2D vector for Glimpse Sensor location representation. This modification
use 3D vector to represent the location and attention's scale.

The research goal of this model has also changed from image classification to
unsupervised visual representation learning.
